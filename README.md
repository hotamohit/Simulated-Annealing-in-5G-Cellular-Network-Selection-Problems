The wireless network selection game has P clients connect to K base stations. We assume one client can only connect to one base station. The objective is to schedule clients on base stations to minimize interference and optimize throughput. Path loss is a major component in the analysis of the throughout of a telecommunication system. In our research, we use SUI path loss model [1] to calculate path loss. We introduce two different ways to measure the optimum schedule of clients. One is to maximize the sum of each clientâ€™s throughput, called max-sum measure. Another is to maximize the minimum throughput among all clients, called max-min measure. For problems where finding an approximate global optimum is more important than finding a precise local optimum in a fixed amount of time, simulated annealing [2] may be preferable to other alternatives. Therefore, we use simulated annealing algorithm to find the optimum schedule of clients.
